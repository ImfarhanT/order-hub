-- ðŸ”§ Fix Shipments Foreign Key Constraint ðŸ”§
-- This will fix the foreign key to reference orders_v2 instead of orders

-- Drop the existing shipments table
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS shipments CASCADE;

-- Recreate the shipments table with correct foreign key
CREATE TABLE shipments (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    order_id UUID NOT NULL,
    tracking_number TEXT NOT NULL,
    carrier TEXT NOT NULL,
    status TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'pending',
    tracking_url TEXT,
    shipped_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    estimated_delivery TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    delivered_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    notes TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Add foreign key constraint to orders_v2 table (using correct column name 'Id')
ALTER TABLE shipments 
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_shipments_orders_order_id 
FOREIGN KEY (order_id) REFERENCES orders_v2("Id") ON DELETE CASCADE;

-- Add unique constraint on order_id (one shipment per order)
ALTER TABLE shipments 
ADD CONSTRAINT uk_shipments_order_id UNIQUE (order_id);

-- Create indexes for better performance
CREATE INDEX ix_shipments_carrier ON shipments(carrier);
CREATE INDEX ix_shipments_status ON shipments(status);
CREATE INDEX ix_shipments_tracking_number ON shipments(tracking_number);

-- Add comments
